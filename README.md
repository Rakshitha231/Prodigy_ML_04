# Prodigy_ML_04
This project focuses on building a robust hand gesture recognition model using deep learning techniques to classify various hand gestures from video/image data. It is part of my virtual internship with Prodigy Infotech under their machine learning stream.

# 📌 Objective
To develop a deep learning-based system that can accurately identify and classify hand gestures from images or video frames, enabling gesture-based control systems and enhancing human-computer interaction (HCI) experiences.
